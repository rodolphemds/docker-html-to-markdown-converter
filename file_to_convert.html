<h2>1.9.0.280 stable</h2>
<p>Use more stable websocket pkg in go program<br>Add alexa, snowglobe, and robot info section to golang program<br>Settings now update probably as fast as they can now in the web app<br>Going directly to the web app to the first time brings you to the auth screen, you dont have to press a button</p>
<hr>
<h2>1.9.0.279 stable</h2> <p>All SDK communication has been implemented into the golang program<br>Added location, time zone, and cpu/ram performance chooser to web app<br>Removed some now-not-required scripts<br>Added error for if GUID isnt gotten from bot</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.278 stable</h2> <p>Web app has a whole new look thanks to xanathon<br>Many functions are now directly implemented in the golang program instead of in bash scripts<br>Snowglobe command is now compatible with 1.8<br>Released to stable</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.277 unstable</h2> <p>Setting statuses update much faster and are more reliable<br>Added a snore toggle to the web app<br>Stopped vector-ctrl from logging in /data/session.log</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.276 unstable</h2> <p>Gave web app a black background<br>The settings statuses should be a lot more reliable<br>Nano now has long text wrapping disabled by default</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.275 unstable</h2> <p>Added support for latest escape pod version</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.274 unstable</h2> <p>Added temp format, time format, and server environment to the web app<br>With the server environment section, you can configure the bot for escape pod with one button<br>Now you can onboard Vector with the servers with the web app, you just need to connect him to wifi via BLE first</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.273 unstable</h2> <p>Added locale and rainbow eyes toggle to the app<br>Now the app shows the current settings and updates when a new one is set<br>Fault code handler restarts the software on failure</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.272 unstable</h2> <p>Added old onboarding wakeup animation from 1.0<br>Prettyified the new web app files</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.271 unstable</h2> <p>Authentication is now built right into the web api. Now you can just go to http://vectorip:8080 in a browser and do what it tells you to do (replace vectorip with vector's actual ip, found in CCIS).</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.270 unstable</h2> <p>Include websocat so intents work via the web app</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.269 unstable</h2> <p>Added a new http web app which can be accessed at http://vector_ip:8080 (replacing vector_ip with vector's actual ip).<br> My goal is to make this be a full mobile app replacement. Currently it has the ability to set eye color (custom too) and volume. It can also launch intents and set a timer for a specified amount of time.<br> This requires authentication with your Anki account. Right now you need to do this to authenticate:<br> SSH in and run these commands: 'mkdir -p /data/protected' 'echo "email" > /data/protected/username' 'echo "password" > /data/protected/password' '/anki/bin/vector-ctrl'<br> Make sure to not include the single quotes (') and to replace email with your actual Anki email address and password with your actual Anki password. After this, you should be authenticated.<br><br> Also fixed some LocalizedStrings<br><br> Plans: Expand the http web app with more options and possible a remote-control feature. Definetely add a better authentication method. I also plan to add an easy way to swap out sounds for whichever ones you want (a selection between 1.8, 1.6, 1.5, etc). I may also add a way to downgrade to 1.6.</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.268 unstable</h2> <p>Re-add custom onboarding sprites<br>Re-add custom localized strings</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.267 unstable</h2> <p>Enable extra bootup animations</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.266 unstable</h2> <p>Updating to 1.8.1<br>Fixed loosepixel animation<br>Things that will be added soon: web interface on port 8080 which can be used to get vector's status, easy way to perform intents (and intents with paramaters: like timer, weather, "my name is", etc), setting location, setting locale, and more. As part of this, I also plan to include C0RE's victor-ctrl script so the bot can communicate with the SDK on it's own.</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.264 stable</h2> <p>Reverted changes due to updating bugs</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.263 stable</h2> <p>Fix freqchange, release to stable</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.262 unstable</h2> <p>Fix some behavior files, make freqchange set cpu governer to performance if freq is 1333333</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.261 unstable</h2> <p>Fix easter egg</p> <hr> <h2>1.9.0.260 unstable</h2> <p>Increase image size, now there is ~870 MB to work with instead of 609 MB.
